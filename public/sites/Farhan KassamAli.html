	<h2> Al-Ummah <h2>
		<p> Al-Ummah has been an amazing experience. I have gotten the opportunity to experience a plethora of awesome and cool things 	that have changed who I am as a person </p>

  		<tr> Pros
    			<td>You meet people from all over the country</td>
   			<td>The friendships established are truly one of a kind</td> 
    			<td>You gain a deeper understanding of what it means to be an Ismaili</td>
    			<td>You get a rest hour, bhas, bais, uncles, and aunties that are just the best </td>
  		</tr>
  		<tr> Cons
    			<td>The food is an average 4/10</td>
    			<td>You have 12 hour days</td> 
    			<td>No phone, no internet, no gum, no candy, and no soda</td>

	<h2> So should I consider applying? </h2>
			<p> All I can say is that I have loved every moment of being in Al-Ummah, through all the late nights and early mornings and 	terrible dinners to singing together. It is an experience of a lifetime that I would highly recommend for everyone. And if you don't trust me, trust 	Aly Uncle </p>
