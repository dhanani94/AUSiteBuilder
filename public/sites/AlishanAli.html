	<h1>Alishan Ali</h1>
	<p><font size = "5">My name is Alishan Ali and I was born in Tucker, GA. I lived in Georgia for most of my life but spent 4 years growing up in Sugarland, TX. I enjoy playing football and basketball. I also love to run long distances. However, my favorite thing to do is sleeping. I also love to watch random shows on Netflix. I am currently watching New Girl and a few other shows. My favorite shows of all time have to be Friends, How I met your mother, and Avatar the Last Airbender. </font></p>

	<p><font size= "5">Some of my favorite things to do is listening to music, going on long drives, and adventuring, whether it means a hike or even just exploring a part of the city you haven't been to.</font></p>
